## 📊 Data Visualizations

### 🔁 Start & End Locations

My Tableau map revealed a key difference:

- **Start Locations**: Members and casual riders start from mostly the same areas.
- **End Locations**:  
  - **Casual Riders** often end near **Navy Pier**, around a 13-minute scenic ride.
  - **Members** typically ride across the **bridge to West Loop Gate**, likely commuting into downtown offices.

### 🕔 Peak Ride Times

- **Members**: Peak at **Wednesday 5 PM** — consistent with workday commute.
- **Casual Riders**: Peak at **Saturday 5 PM** — suggests recreational or social usage.

### 📈 Rides by Day of Week

## 💡 Recommendation: The *Weekend Warrior Pass*

To convert casual riders, Cyclistic should introduce a **“Weekend Warrior Pass”**:

- **Offer**: Discounted 2-day membership for Saturdays and Sundays.
- **Promotion channels**: Geo-targeted ads at major start stations, social media ads around spring/summer.
- **Benefits**:
  - Hooks casual users with flexibility and affordability
  - Encourages recurring weekend ridership
  - Gathers more user data to promote full membership later
